=======================
Django output validator
=======================

This app validates all the HTML (or potentially other data) that is generated by
your Django project. This is meant to be used only in development.

Installation
============

* Run setup.py to install the package into your python path.

* Add "output_validator" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.

* If you have removed ``"django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader"`` from
  your TEMPLATE_LOADERS, you need to add the 'templates' folder to your
  TEMPLATE_DIRS setting.

* Insert the middleware
  ``"output_validator.middleware.ValidatorMiddleware"``
  near the beginning of the middleware list (which means it will get
  the the response object after everything else). It must be after
  every middleware that does post-processing, but mustn't be after
  GZip, since it can't handle gzipped HTML. ( I just disable the GZip
  middleware for development)

* Alter your URL conf to include the URLs for the validator. You need
  this line inserted somewhere::

      (r'^validator/', include('output_validator.urls'))

* Add a setting to tell the app where to find the 'validate'
  executable used for validation. This is a dictionary of mimetypes
  and corresponding validators, allowing this app to be extended to
  any other generated content::

      OUTPUT_VALIDATOR_VALIDATORS = {
        'text/html': '/usr/bin/validate',
        'application/xml+xhtml': '/usr/bin/validate',
      }

  I usually use a small wrapper for this executable that pops up
  a message when it fails - the following works for GNOME
  (if you have the notify-send program installed)::

      #!/bin/sh
      validate "$1" || {
          notify-send "Validation failed";
      }

* Finally, run the django admin script to set up the database tables::

    ./manage.py --settings="yourproject.settings" syncdb

  OR, if you are using South::

    ./manage.py --settings="yourproject.settings" migrate output_validator

* Optionally, set the following settings:

  * OUTPUT_VALIDATOR_IGNORE_PATHS - this is a list of path prefixes that
    will be ignored.  For example, if you have the admin at ``/admin/``
    you can ignore any errors in the admin with this::

        OUTPUT_VALIDATOR_IGNORE_PATHS = [
            '/admin/',
        ]


Usage
=====

When browsing any of your pages in development, all HTML will be validated. If
it fails, it will be logged. You can see all failures at
'http://localhost:8000/validator/' (assuming local development and the URL conf
suggested above). Use the app to delete old failures once they have been fixed.
